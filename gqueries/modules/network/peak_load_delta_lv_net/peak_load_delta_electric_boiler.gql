# This is an ugly, temporary query because number_of_units doesn't work as intended for this technology.
# 71/1000 is the current share of electric boilers. It is entered like this since decimals apparently can't be entered in the query.

# V(households_water_heater_resistive_electricity ," simult_we*electricity_input_conversion*typical_input_capacity_in_mw*(number_of_units-peak_load_units_present)")
