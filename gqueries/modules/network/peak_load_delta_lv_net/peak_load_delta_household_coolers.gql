- deprecated_key = peak_load_delta_hh_coolers
# This is an ugly query that can only be fixed once number_of_units is working properly for space heating/cooling technologies.
# In this query the peak load delta of technologies is calculated, but it is necessary to subtract the impact due to airconditioners in the present scenario
# Since the number of units isn't working for these technologies, it is solved by using the hard number '1' (i.e. the share of airco in present scenario) and multiplying by AREA(number_households)
# If number of units were working the query would be:
# SUM(V(Q(household_coolers_in_network_calculation) ," simult_sd*electricity_input_conversion*typical_input_capacity_in_mw*(number_of_units-peak_load_units_present)"))
