# Required new LV-network capacity during a winter day.
# Query takes into account all technologies attached to the LV-network
# Query sums the newly required capacities per technology (peak_laod_in_mw) and adds these to the currently used capacity on the network (network_capacity_used_in_mw)
# If the total required capacity DOES NOT exceeds the available capacity (network_capacity_available_in_mw), return 0
# If the total required capacity DOES exceed the available capacity return difference between required and available capacity
