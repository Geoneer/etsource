# This Gquery calculates the additional peak load as a result of the electrical technologies that are installed in a scenario for a summer evening
# This Gquery takes into account all technologies attached to the LV-network
# If the additional peak load in the future scenario is lower than in the present scenario, this Gquery returns 0.0
