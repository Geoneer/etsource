# The assumption is made that the O&M costs scale linearly with capacity. This query therefore calculates the required O&M costs based on the new capacity and multiplies by the current O&M costs.
# The current O&M costs are estimated at 155.783.851 EURO.  This is 1/6th of the current O&M costs of Stedin, Enexis, and Alliander. 
# NOTE!! The curent costs are inserted here as a hard value! This eventually needs to be moved to a variable so that it easily can be updated in the future.
