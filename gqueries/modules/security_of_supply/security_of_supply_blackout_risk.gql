# calculates the % chance (factor between 0 and 1) of a blackout: that supply is less than demand
# The NORMCDF calculation works iteratively and returns an incorrect value if available capacity is significantly greater than demand.
# And if statement has therefore been included to set the blackout risk to 0 in this case.
