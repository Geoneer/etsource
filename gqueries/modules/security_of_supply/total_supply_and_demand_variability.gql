# Total variability in both supply and demand
# Variability is calculated as the root of the sum of squares of individual variabilities
# 2011-12-12: The variability parameter is now 1-capacity credit. For wind this is 0.7 and solar 1.0
# The sum of squares therefore now gives the total variation expected (approximately 3 standard deviations), and therefore it is divided by 3
