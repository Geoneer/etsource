# Score calculated for etflex.
# The basis of the score is 1000, minus 5 times the costs in billions, minus the CO2 emissions in Mton,
# plus 5x the percentage renewability of the scenario, minus 10x the number of nuclear power plants (because of nuclear waste).
# There are additional minus points for sliders:
# - 0.02 points for each percentage of LEDs or solar heater
# - 0.10 points for each percentage of fuel cell, electric car or heatpump
# The result is multiplied by 2 factors:
# - the reliability of the electricity production squared,
# - the balance in electricity production.

- unit = #
