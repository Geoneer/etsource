# Score calculated for etflex.
# The basis of the score is 1000, minus 4 times the costs in billions, minus the CO2 emissions in Mton.
# This number is multiplied by 3 factors:
# the reliability of the electricity production squared,
# the percentage of imbalance in electricity production,
# the percentage renewability of the scenario

- unit = #
