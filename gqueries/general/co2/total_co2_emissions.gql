# Take note: The imported electricity is not included because it is assigned no CO2 emission as primary carrier. This query should be fixed when imported electricity is assigned with CO2.

# MECE groups have the same total_co2_emissions, with the exception of primary_demand:

# We exclude the energy coming from non-energetic use converters. As they

# final_demand.primary_co2_emission == useful_demand.primary_co2_emission != primary_demand.primary_co2_emission
