# Correction for the fact that heating and hot water combi technologies are counted double or triple.
# First all double or triple technologies are subtracted to remove them from the 
# 'costs_of_produced_heat_plus_insulation' query which looks like this:
#
#- query =
#    SUM( 
#      V(
#        G(cost_traditional_heat),
#        G(cost_heat_pumps),
#        total_costs_per(:converter)
#      ), 
#      Q(costs_of_insulation),
#      Q(dashboard_total_cost_correction)
#    )
#
# Next, for households, the MAXIMUM value is taken for combi technologies.
# For heat-pumps that also provide cooling, the cooling is considered complimentary 
# EXCEPT if cooling is the only use of the technology.
# For buildings, the MAXIMUM of space heating and cooling is taken for heat pumps.
