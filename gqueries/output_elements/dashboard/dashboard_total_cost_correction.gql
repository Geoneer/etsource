# Correction for the fact that heating and cooling technologies are counted double.
# First all double technologies are subtracted to remove them from the

#- query =
#   SUM(
#     V(
#       G(cost_traditional_heat),

#     Q(costs_of_imported_heat),
#     Q(dashboard_total_cost_correction),
#     Q(hydrogen_heat_correction)
#   )
# Next, for households and buildings, the MAXIMUM value for the FIXED costs is
# taken for heat pumps that provide heating and cooling.
# Variable costs need to be taken into account for all technologies and should not be corrected.
