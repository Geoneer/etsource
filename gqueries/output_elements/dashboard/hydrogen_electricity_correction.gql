# Correction for the fact that electricity production technologies can use hydrogen and
# the cost of this hydrogen is taken into account in the total_costs_per(:converter) methods.
# The total costs for hydrogen production and transport are already explicitly taken into
# account in the dashboard.
# Costs for production and transport are included in the hydrogen cost/price and are counted
# twice. 
# Here we subtract the cost for the hydrogen used in electricity production technologies.
